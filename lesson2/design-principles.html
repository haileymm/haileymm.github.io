            <p>The Pottery Barn website is very image heavy. To handle this, their alignment 
              helps their site look clean and interesting. Their grid system can be seen in their
              mobile view, but it is much more apparent in larger viewports.</p>

            <p>The Scheels site is a great example of contrast. The main colors for 
              their site are bright red, black, and white. Any combination of those colors have good
              contrast when used together. Their whole site has high contrast. They
              make sure the text that is placed over images is highly readable.

            <p>The Ting home page is very simple. They give just one main button option to start.
              When people get to the site, it is easy to decide where to go and what to do because
              the site is simple and only has a few options on the home page.
